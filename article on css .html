    CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
    CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
    Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify
     the process of making web pages presentable.
    CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts,
    the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used,
    layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
    
    CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly,
    CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

  a user can be stress-free with its older language versions as it is well compatible even with the older versions.
  Because of this, even if the applications of CSS is developed in some older version of programming language 
  CSS styling can be used to associate directly with the e-commerce web.

  Also, different add-ins and library files that are present can be modified and updated by CSS
  libraries and use while creating the web applications, and the source codes associated with it can be implemented by
  uses of CSS in the HTML framework to develop e-commerce web platform from the scratch.

 role while performing website maintenance. It makes website maintenance much easier.

    We can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
    We can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.
    We are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time.

    To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.
    Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.
